<p>The insect is attracted by the colour of the flowers, the various patterns on the petals, the shape and size of the petals and the smell of the flowers. It should be noted, however, that each insect has its own preference in terms of flower colours. Butterflies that live during the day, for example, like blue, purple or pink flowers, those that fly at night love white flowers and diptera or yellow flowers. Insects also pay attention to the shape of the flowers. Not all insects can feed on all kinds of flowers. Butterflies with long proboscis absorb nectar at the bottom of long tubes on some flowers, but insects with shorter mouthparts do not have the same faculties.</p>

<p>Insects can also detect several types of odours. These can be flowery and pleasant smells that humans also enjoy. It is an odour that attracts hymenoptera and lepidoptera. Smells that are not perceptible to humans, such as sex pheromones, are attractive to insects. Orchids produce this kind of odour, attracting the female bees and subsequently the males, which leads to pollination.</p>

<p>There are smells that we find unpleasant, such as the smell of rotting meat. But Diptera like these smells. When pollen or nectar is smelly, it emits a signal that activates the pollinators. In this way, they will avoid making unnecessary visits to flowers that have already been visited by another insect.</p>

<p>The patterns and symmetry of the flowers are also a kind of guide for the insects. There are flowers that are not united, and which display dots, lines or spots that help the insect to find the nectar. The symmetry of the flowers is also an attraction for insects. It is the radially symmetrical flowers that sometimes attract more insects because they can be placed in different positions.</p>
