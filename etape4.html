    <p>Pollination ensures the sexual reproduction of the plants. Pollination also gives insects an advantage: the nectar or pollen they feed on. Pollination is a mutualistic relationship, i.e. both partners benefit from it.</p>

<p>Nectar and pollen are sometimes described as a reward, based on the fact that insects also benefit from pollination. Nectar has no other function than to attract insects to the flower. It is produced by glands called nectaries, which can be found in different parts of the flower.</p>
