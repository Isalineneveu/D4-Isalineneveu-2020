    <h2>Back to the beehive</h2>

</div>
    <p>To feed, bees look for nectar and pollen from flowers. They carry it to the hive in balls on their legs. Contrary to appearances, it will be of little use for pollination because it has been compacted. However, each time they pass over a flower, the insects retain the grains thanks to the branched hairs that cover their body. This pollen, carried from corolla to corolla, is involved in pollination by falling on flowers with mature stamens.</p>

<p>Thus, the bee, whose first virtue many believe is to produce honey, plays a much more important role by its essential contribution to the development and maintenance of ecosystems. It ensures, exclusively or principally, the fertilisation of the majority of plant species.</p>
